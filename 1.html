<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5">The
   HyperText Markup</a> <strong>Language</strong> or <u>HTML</u> is the standard markup
    language for
documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
 technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages
  such as JavaScript.<br>
  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
   and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
   HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
   included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
 images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
  rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by
  denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
   links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
   written using angle brackets.
